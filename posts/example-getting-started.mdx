## Welcome to Your Blog

This is an example post to help you understand how the MDX blog works. You can delete this file once you're ready to write your own content.

## Writing in MDX

MDX allows you to write JSX directly in your markdown files. This means you can use React components alongside your regular markdown content.

### Frontmatter

Every post needs frontmatter at the top. Here are the available fields:

- `title` - The title of your post
- `date` - Publication date (e.g., "January 1st, 2025")
- `tldr` - A short summary shown at the top of the post
- `author` - Author name
- `authorImage` - Path to author avatar image
- `readingTime` - Estimated reading time
- `category` - Post category (Tutorial, Guide, News, Opinion, or General)
- `description` - Meta description for SEO

### Using Images

You can use the Next.js Image component directly in your MDX:

```jsx
<Image 
  src="/path/to/image.jpg"
  alt="Description"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>
```

## Table of Contents

The table of contents is automatically generated from your h2 headings. Each heading gets an anchor link, and the ToC highlights the current section as you scroll.

## Styling

The blog uses Tailwind CSS Typography plugin for beautiful prose styling. Both light and dark modes are supported out of the box.

## Next Steps

1. Create a `/posts` directory in your project root
2. Add your MDX files there
3. Customize the category colors in `components/category-badge.tsx`
4. Update the metadata in `app/blog/page.tsx`
5. Add your author images to `/public/authors/`

Happy writing! 🎉
